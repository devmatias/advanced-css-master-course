## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?

Unfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).
